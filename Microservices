# What is Cloud Native?
The term cloud native refers to the concept of building and running applications to take advantage of the distributed computing offered by the cloud delivery model.

# Key Pillars of Cloud Native Development

# MICROSERVICES
Microservices enable you to design your application as a collection of loosely coupled services
# CONTAINERS
Containers are packages of software that contain all the necessary elements to run in any environment
# DEVOPS
Devops is a combination of development and operations brought together to create a unified infrastructure designed to maximise productivity.
# CI/CD
A CI/CD pipeline automates your software delivery process.This help developers merge and test code more frequently.
# SERVICE MESH
A service mesh is a configurable low latency infrastructure layer that controls the interaction between a network of microservices.

# What are Microservices?
In a microservice architecture each microservice owns a simple task and communicates with clients or other microservices by using lightweight communication mechanisms such as RESTAPI requests.
 Microservices are used to design an application that is:
1.Mulitilingual:-supporting, processing, or interacting with more than one human or programming language.
2.Loosely Coupled with other services:-Changes in one service donâ€™t directly affect other services.Each service can function, deploy, and scale independently.
3.Easy to Maintain
4.Easily Scalable and highly available.
5.Failures resistant.

# Microservices Architecture: Sample E-Commerce Application
Microservices Enables you to design your application as a collection of loosely coupled services.They follow the share-nothing Model and run as stateless processes.This Approach makes it easier to scale and maintain its application.

# Microservices vs Monolithic Architecture
